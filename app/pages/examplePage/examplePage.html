<!--
    This is an example of a page (aka a view), and is most
    often just going to be a holding place that will contain components.

    For the time being, we'll just use ng-include to get a component
    into the page, but down the road we'll probably switch over
    to making the components into directives, just to keep things neater.

    <div ng-controller="examplePageController" class="container-fluid">

        <!-- how to include a component -->
        <div ng-include="../components/exampleTemplate/exampleTemplate.html"></div>

        <!-- how to include a directive -->
        <div example-directive example="someValue"></div>

    </div>
